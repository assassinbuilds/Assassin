## Welcome to the Command Center

Tech Assassin is a high-performance community infrastructure designed for elite developers, security researchers, and system architects. It serves as a unified ecosystem where field operatives synchronize on mission-critical sprints, track professional progression via an advanced gamification engine, and collaborate on dismantling technical monoliths.

The platform provides a seamless experience across web and mobile, ensuring operatives stay connected to the network through real-time notifications, presence tracking, and tactical dashboards.

---

## System Overview

### Core Architecture
The platform is built on a distributed architecture leveraging high-concurrency technologies:
- Frontend (Web): A high-fidelity interface built with React 18.3 and Vite 5.4, utilizing Framer Motion 12.3 for cinematic animations.
- Mobile (Android): A native-performing application built with Expo 52, featuring hardware-accelerated animations via Reanimated 3.
- Backend (API): A robust Next.js 14.2 server architecture providing a unified RESTful interface with integrated Zod validation.
- Data Layer: PostgreSQL 15 with Supabase-managed authentication and real-time database synchronization.

### Technical Depth
- Materialized Views: Utilizing PostgreSQL materialized views for high-performance ranking calculations and trend analysis.
- Real-time Synchronization: Advanced presence tracking and activity monitoring via dedicated SQL-level activity streams.
- Security Infrastructure: Integrated Row-Level Security (RLS) and JWT-based session management for mission-critical data protection.

## Features

### Tacticial Hub & Command Center
- Unified Dashboard: Real-time network status, mission milestones, and operative telemetry.
- Mission Board: Discovery and deployment into upcoming tactical hackathons and sprints.
- Real-time Comms: Encrypted intelligence feeds and tactical broadcasts.

### Advanced Gamification Engine
- Experience (XP) Tracking: Dynamic XP allocation based on mission complexity and contribution quality.
- Rank Progression: Hierarchical progression system from Junior Operative to Lead Architect.
- Streaks & Consistency: Continuous deployment rewards and activity streaks to maintain operative focus.
- Honor Badges: Cryptographically verifiable badges for mastery in specific technical domains.

### Global Intelligence & Rankings
- Unified Leaderboard: High-performance ranking system with up/down trend indicators.
- Operative Dossiers: Comprehensive profiles showcasing skill matrices, GitHub telemetry, and mission history.
- Architect Facepiles: Interactive visualization of mission lead contributors and field architects.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18.x or 20.x (LTS recommended)
- PostgreSQL 15+ (Local or Managed)
- Git

### Installation
1. Clone the operative repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aryansondharva/TechAssassin.git
cd TechAssassin
```

2. Initialize backend infrastructure:
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

3. Initialize client interface:
```bash
cd ../Client
npm install
```

### Configuration
1. Setup environment variables in `backend/.env.local`:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_api_link
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_public_anon_key
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/techassassin
JWT_SECRET=minimum_32_character_security_key
```

### Database Deployment
Initialize the database layer by executing the following scripts in order:
1. SQL/20260326000001_create_realtime_presence_activity.sql
2. SQL/create_leaderboard_materialized_view.sql
3. SQL/optimize_badge_criteria_indexes.sql

---

## Development & Testing

Run the environment using dedicated terminals:

Backend Terminal:
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

Web Terminal:
```bash
cd Client
npm run dev
```

Mobile Terminal:
```bash
cd Mobile
npx expo start
```

Testing Suite (Vitest):
```bash
cd backend
npm test
```

---

## Deployment Strategy
Web and API components are optimized for deployment on Vercel. Database migrations should be applied to production using the SQL scripts located in the /SQL directory. Mobile builds are managed via Expo Application Services (EAS).
